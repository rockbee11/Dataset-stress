He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed. I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day.

There is a stigma about asking for help in the Navy and it needs to change. Basically, if you take any meds you get treated like a black sheep. If you go to medical and they give you meds, you get removed from your duties and everyone else carries your load while you are forced to stand around them not allowed to do anything. If you do get out of the navy because you spoke out about being depressed, anxious, or having symptoms of PTSD then you would be seperated from the Navy and sent home.",1320,1,0.571428571,1483859673,45,8.234390244,123,43.57,97.88,11.59,14.53,24.6,14.63,88.62,60.16,17.89,12.2,0.81,0,8.94,0.81,1.63,5.69,4.88,15.45,8.94,4.88,9.76,1.63,20.33,1.63,1.63,1.63,0.81,1.63,3.25,0.81,1.63,0.81,0,0.81,19.51,0,0,0.81,0,13.82,0.81,3.25,4.07,5.69,0.81,5.69,3.25,1.63,1.63,0,1.63,0,1.63,0,0,8.13,0.81,0.81,4.07,4.07,0,1.63,15.45,1.63,11.38,4.07,5.69,1.63,0.81,0,0.81,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.38,4.07,4.07,0,0,0,0,0.81,0,0.81,1.63,0,2.8571,2.8889,3,1,1,1,1.70665,1.47339,1.80599,1,14,7.562723577,-0.143333333,45,16,96,4,95,60,7,50,0

My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day. My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents. I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it.
